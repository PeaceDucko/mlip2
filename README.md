# Generating Monet images using CycleGAN and MobileNetV2
This repository houses notebooks belonging to the "GAN Getting-Started" competition, hosted by Kaggle. The notebooks have been set up by three students of team 2 of the Radboud University Masters course "Machine Learning in Practice".

# Dataset
The dataset consists of 7028 real-life photos and 300 images from Claude Monet. All the images are RBG with a size of 256x256.

# Goal
The goal of this competition is to generate Monet-style images out of the real-life photos using GAN-based models. For our implementations we decided to use CycleGAN.

# Specifications
The notebooks present in this repository were directly downloaded from Kaggle. The notebooks were written in Python and ran on  a Kaggle TPU v3-8 accelerator. Additionally, libraries like Tensorflow, Keras, numpy and scipy were used.
